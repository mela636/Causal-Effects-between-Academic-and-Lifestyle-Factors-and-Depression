Fitting the Logistic Model
```{r}
# checking the levels of sleep duration as, at some point, it resulted in null
levels(df$Sleep_Duration)
```


```{r}
# making sure Depression is a factor due to prior errors I was receiving
df$Depression <- factor(df$Depression, levels = c("No", "Yes"))

# fit the logistic regression model
model <- glm(Depression ~ Academic_Pressure + Financial_Stress + Sleep_Duration,
             data = df, family = binomial)

# show the summary 
summary(model)
```
```{r}
# gives a tidy summary of the glm model
tidy_results <- tidy(model)

# prints results
print(tidy_results)
```

```{r}
# assess the goodness of fit
pR2(model)

hltest <- hoslem.test(model$y, fitted(model), g=10)
hltest

```

```{r}
X <- model.matrix(model)

# calculate the Condition Number for multicollinearity 
condition_number <- kappa(X)

# print
print(condition_number)
```

```{r}
# calculate residuals
residuals <- residuals(model, type = "deviance")

# plot residuals to check for patterns
plot(residuals, main = "Deviance Residuals", xlab = "Index", ylab = "Residuals")

# check for influential observations
influence <- influence.measures(model)
summary(influence)

```

```{r}
# odds Ratios interpretation 
odds_ratios <- exp(coef(model))
odds_ratios
```
